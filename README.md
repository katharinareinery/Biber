This software project was carried out from the summer semester to the winter semester 2018/2019 and got the name Biber from us.

Biber lets the user view the image processing from a technical side. During the processing of the graphic, the manual operation of the filter with its different setting options should enable it to understand which filter changes the image in which direction.
